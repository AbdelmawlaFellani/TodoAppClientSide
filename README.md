# Todo App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of a simple todo app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

it's one of my first projects on mern stack technology
## Features

- Add new todos
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12.0.0)

## Getting Started

When starting to develop this application you should always start simple,
and by that i mean you should follow few simple steps so it makes it easy to complete
for me i used this :
1. Plan Before You Code:

    Outline the main functionalities: Adding tasks, displaying tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks.
    Decide on the basic structure: You'll need components for the Todo list, individual Todo items, and a form to add new tasks.

2. Start Small:

    Begin with just displaying a static list of tasks without any interactivity.

3. Single Responsibility Principle:

    Create separate components for the Todo list, Todo item, and the form to add tasks.

4. Refactor as You Go:

    If a component becomes too complex, break it down into smaller components. For example, if your form component is handling both form input and API calls, split it into separate components.

5. Use Descriptive Naming:

    Name your components and functions in a clear and descriptive manner. For example, TodoList is more readable than List.

6. Avoid Premature Optimization:

    Focus on getting the core functionality working first. Don't worry about optimizing performance until later.

7. Simplify UI:

    Use a UI library like Material-UI to simplify the styling of your components.

8. Regular Testing:

    Test your app after adding each new feature to catch bugs early.

9. Seek Feedback:

    Share your code with peers or online communities and ask for feedback on code organization and simplicity.

10. Iterate:

    Start with the basic functionality and then consider adding more features like task completion and deletion.

11. Practice Patience:

    Keep in mind that simplicity comes with practice. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them.
